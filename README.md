Remasdtadis is a fork of Tunapanda's "fork" of the sadly now defunct [remastersys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remastersys). 
They say  - "'fork' is in quotes because so far we haven't changed much. This is mostly to preserve the original- http://www.tunapanda.org/"

Which is good for me, because I want to use it to learn stuff...

Todo

- sed Remastersys - remastadis
- Test and hack, playabout accordingly

(currently untested and merely a plaything for learning - might break stuff :/ )
