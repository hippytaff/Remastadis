                                                   ## Remastadis ##
Remasdtadis is a fork of Tunapanda's "fork" of the sadly now defunct [remastersys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remastersys). They say "fork" is in quotes because so far we haven't changed much. This is mostly to preserve the original- http://www.tunapanda.org/"

Which is good for me, because I want to use it to learn stuff...

Todo

- sed Remastersys - remastadis
- Proper readme
- Install.txt
- Support for Moksha/E17 Desktop/Bodhilinux.
- Test and hack accordingly

(currently untested - might break stuff :/ )
